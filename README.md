## Profile UI ðŸ‘§

This is a simple Flutter Profile UI application. It shows the profile details of Erza Scarlet, one of my favourite anime characters from Fairy Tail :smile:. It uses <b>stateful</b> Profile widget where whenever the button is pressed, the count of the number of battles increases by one.
